# Task 1: X-ray analysis with MedGemma
xray_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the X-ray image at {image_url} using the 'xray_image_tool'.

    Your analysis should include:

    1. Identify visible pulmonary or thoracic anomalies
    2. For each anomaly found, describe:
       - Anatomical region (e.g., right mid-lung zone, left lower lobe)
       - Relative position (upper/middle/lower, medial/lateral)
       - Estimated size (small, medium, large)
       - Visual characteristics (mild opacity, consolidation, nodular, etc.)
    3. Evaluate visible normal structures (heart, mediastinum, diaphragm)
    4. Technical quality of the image

    RULES:
    - Focus only on medical visual interpretation
    - Be detailed in descriptions
    - Return ONLY valid JSON

# Task 2: Medical report writing
report_writing_task:
  description: >
    Based on the X-ray analysis provided by the previous agent, write a 
    formal and complete radiology report.

    The report should follow the standard structure:

    1. TECHNIQUE: Briefly describe the type of exam
    2. FINDINGS: List all relevant positive and negative findings
    3. IMPRESSION: Provide the most likely diagnosis with probability
    4. RECOMMENDATIONS: Suggest next steps if necessary

    RULES:
    - Use formal but clear medical language
    - Base strictly on the provided data
    - Assign probability as percentage (0-100)
    - Return ONLY valid JSON

      "technique": "string",
      "findings": "string",
      "impression": {{

# Task 3: Circle anomaly and save image
annotate_image_task:
  description: >
    Use the 'xray_anomaly_locator' tool to automatically locate and circle 
    anomalies in the X-ray image.

    Image: {image_url}

    Instructions:
    1. Execute the tool passing the image path
    2. The tool will:
       - Automatically detect pathologies using AI
       - Circle anomaly regions on the original image
       - Save the annotated image
    3. Return the saved image path and detection information

    IMPORTANT:
    - The tool automatically detects: Pneumonia, Mass, Consolidation, 
      Cardiomegaly, Edema, Effusion, Emphysema, Fibrosis, etc.
    - If no significant anomaly is detected (probability < 60%), 
      the tool will return anomaly_found: false

  expected_output: >
    {{
      "heatmap_image_path": "string",
      "annotated_image_path": "string",
      "pathologies_detected": [

write_report_task:
  description: >
    Based on the previous X-ray analysis and the detected anomalies (including the annotated image), write a clear, concise, and comprehensive medical report.

    The report MUST include:
    1. Summary of findings (from the analysis)
    2. Detailed description of the detected anomaly/anomalies, including location, type, size, and visual characteristics
    3. Most likely diagnosis and differential diagnoses
    4. Recommendations for further evaluation or treatment
    5. Path to the original image, the annotated image and the heatmap image (with circles)
    6. A visual comparison section describing the difference between the original and annotated images

    RULES:
    - Use clear, objective, and formal medical language
    - Base the report strictly on the provided analysis and detected anomalies
    - Include the image paths in the output JSON
    - Return ONLY valid JSON

# show_report_docx:
#   description: >
#     You MUST use the tool "write_docx_tool" to create the DOCX file.
#     DO NOT invent, guess, or hallucinate the file path. You cannot complete this task without calling the tool.

#     Instructions:
#     1. Take the final report JSON output from the previous task.
#     2. Call the "write_docx_tool" passing the necessary data.
#     3. WAIT for the tool to execute and return the real absolute file path.
#     4. Only after the tool returns the path, create your final response.

#   expected_output: >
#     Return the exact path provided by the tool in the following JSON format:
